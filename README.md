# Prototype: RPC + CMake - bootstrap

A minimal application built with CMake that sets up a `pw_rpc` server
and uses Nanopb for protobuf codegen. The app and protobuf codegen builds
without a Pigweed bootstrap. I use a bootstrap to spin up `pw_console` and
verify that I can send an RPC to the app.

## Dependencies

On Debian-based systems, running `./install.sh` should get you
most or everything you need. This list was generated after the
fact so I may have missed something.

## Build

```
./build.sh
```

The build script adds a bunch of Pigweed module paths to the Python
system path. Other than that it's a normal CMake build.

## Run

1. Open a console tab and run `./build/rpc_demo`.

   The app boots up and starts listening on `localhost:33001`.

2. Open another console tab, `cd` into the root of the Pigweed repo, bootstrap,
   and then start a `pw_console` session so that you can test sending an
   RPC to the app.

   ```
   cd third_party/pigweed
   . bootstrap.sh
   python3 ../../../run_console.py --socket-addr localhost:33001
   ```

   We are only using bootstrap here to simplify the prototype. In real-world
   usage I imagine you'd have other ways to send RPCs to devices. I'm not sure
   if it's a big lift to get `pw_console` working without a bootstrap.

3. In the Python REPL of `pw_console` send an RPC to the app.

   ```
   device.rpcs.rpc.ping.PingService.Ping(value="rpc")
   ```

4. In the console tab running the app, you should see `rpc` printed to
   `stdout`.

## Architecture

### Communication

This demo implements only the server side of the RPC communication.

The server uses `pw_rpc::system_server` (configured with the `host` backend),
which listens on a TCP socket (port 33000). Communication over the socket
uses HDLC framing (`pw_hdlc`).

### Proto generation

To allow `pw_console` to interact with our custom `ping.proto` service, the
CMake build automatically generates the standard Python protobuf module
(`ping_pb2.py`) to `build/generated_python`. The `run_console.py` script adds
this directory to `sys.path` and passes the module to `pw_system.console` which
dynamically builds the RPC client at runtime.

## Files

Source files:

*   `//CMakeLists.txt`: Defines the CMake build system, including fetching
    dependencies (Nanopb, Pigweed), generating protobuf code, and defining the
    executable target `rpc_demo`.

*   `//main.cc`: The entry point for the C++ application. It initializes the
    Pigweed system server, registers the `PingService`, and starts the server.

*   `//ping.proto`: Defines the Protocol Buffer service `PingService` with a
    `Ping` method.

*   `//ping.options`: Nanopb options file for `ping.proto`, specifying
    configuration like max size of fields.

*   `//ping_service.h`: Implements the `PingService` defined in `ping.proto`.

*   `//run_console.py`: Python script to launch `pw_console` configured to talk
    to the running application. It sets up the python path to include generated
    protos.

*   `//build.sh`: Bash script to run the build. It configures CMake (if not
    already done) and builds the `rpc_demo` target. It also sets up
    `PYTHONPATH` for the build process.

*   `//install.sh`: Bash script to install system dependencies (on Debian-based
    systems).

Generated files:

*   `//build/generated/ping.pb.h` and `//build/generated/ping.pb.c`: Nanopb
    generated C code for the `ping.proto` messages.

*   `//build/generated/ping.rpc.pb.h`: Pigweed RPC generated C++ header for the
    `ping.proto` service.

*   `//build/generated_python/ping_pb2.py`: Python protobuf module generated
    from `ping.proto`, used by `run_console.py`.

*   `//build/python_packages/`: Contains Python protobuf modules generated from
    Pigweed internal protos, required by Pigweed RPC plugins.
